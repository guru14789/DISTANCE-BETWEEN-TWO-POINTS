# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
import math module
### Step 2: 
Declare the values for x1,x2,y1,y2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Round the result and print the result
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

x1,x2=10,4
y1,y2=6,2
d=((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)**0.5
print(round(d,2))
```
  


### OUTPUT:
![distance record](https://github.com/guru14789/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/151705853/da21b09b-406a-436e-abff-a8c5e633ba4e)


### RESULT:
Thus the distance between two points are successfully executed
